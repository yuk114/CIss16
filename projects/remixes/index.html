Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
why does this world make me feel so small?
temporary highs, and again I fall,
while someone somewhere spins the ball,
glassy buildings and shiny malls,
models dressed up to enthrall, 
doubts and fears, up they crawl,
I stare at you, through it all, 
watching the shadows grow tall,
tell me when will the end befall?
