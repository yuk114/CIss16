  <p class="about1">The Philadelphia Experiment is an alleged military experiment supposed to have been carried out by the U.S. Navy at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania some time around October 28, 1943.
  The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Eldridge (DE-173) was claimed to have been rendered invisible (or "cloaked") to enemy devices.
  The story is widely understood to be a hoax.
  The U.S. Navy maintains that no such experiment was ever conducted, that the details of the story contradict well-established facts about the USS Eldridge, and that the alleged claims do not conform to known physical laws.</p>
  <p class="about2">The experiment was allegedly based on an aspect of some unified field theory, a term coined by Albert Einstein to describe a class of potential theories;
  such theories would aim to describe — mathematically and physically —
  the interrelated nature of the forces that comprise electromagnetic radiation and gravity, in other words,
  uniting the fields of electromagnetism and gravity into a single field.</p>
  <p class="about3">According to some accounts, unspecified "researchers" thought that some version of this field would enable using large electrical generators to bend light around an object via refraction,
  so that the object became completely invisible. The Navy regarded this of military value and, by the same accounts, it sponsored the experiment.
  Another unattributed version of the story proposes that researchers were preparing magnetic and gravitational measurements of the seafloor to detect anomalies,
  supposedly based on Einstein's attempts to understand gravity. In this version, there were also related secret experiments in Nazi Germany to find anti-gravity,
  allegedly led by SS-Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler.</p>
  <p class="about4">There are no reliable, attributable accounts, but in most accounts of the supposed experiment, the USS Eldridge was fitted with the required equipment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
  Testing allegedly began in the summer of 1943, and it was supposedly successful to a limited extent.
  One test allegedly resulted in Eldridge being rendered nearly invisible, with some witnesses reporting a "greenish fog" appearing in its place.
  Crew members supposedly complained of severe nausea afterwards.
  Also, reportedly, when the ship reappeared, some sailors were embedded in the metal structures of the ship, including one sailor who ended up on a deck level below that where he began and had his hand embedded in the steel hull of the ship as well as some sailors who went "completely bananas."
  At that point, the experiment was allegedly altered at the request of the Navy, with the new objective being solely to render the USS Eldridge invisible to radar.
  None of these allegations have been independently substantiated.</p>
  <p class="about5">The conjecture then alleges that the equipment was not properly re-calibrated, but that in spite of this, the experiment was repeated on October 28, 1943.
  This time, Eldridge not only became invisible, but she disappeared from the area in a flash of blue light and teleported to Norfolk, Virginia, over 200 miles (320 km) away.
  It is claimed that Eldridge sat for some time in view of men aboard the ship SS Andrew Furuseth, whereupon Eldridge vanished and then reappeared in Philadelphia at the site it had originally occupied.
  It was also said that the warship went approximately ten minutes back in time.
  Many versions of the tale include descriptions of serious side effects for the crew.
  Some crew members were said to have been physically fused to bulkheads while others suffered from mental disorders, some re-materialized inside out, and still others supposedly vanished.
  It is also claimed that the ship's crew may have been subjected to brainwashing, to maintain the secrecy of the experiment.</p>
