  <p class="about1">Despite being utterly discredited for at leat 100 years, belief in this document had proved remarkably resilient on the internet.
  The text takes the form of an instruction manual to a new member of the "elders", describing how the will run the world through the control of the media and finance,
  and replace the traditional social order with one based on mass manipulation. Scholars generally agree that the Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire,
  fabricated the text in the late 1890s or 1900s but belief in it still persists and particularly in the Middle East.
