  <p class="about1">The Church Committee is the common term referring to the United States Senate Select Committee to Study
  Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, a U.S. Senate committee chaired by Senator Frank Church
  in 1975. A precursor to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the committee investigated intelligence gathering
  for illegality by the CIA and FBI after certain activities had been revealed by the Watergate affair.
  The Committee uncovered, among many other things, that the CIA had violated its charter to perform only gathering of
  intelligence.  For example, the assassinations of Allende in Chile and Mossadegh in Iran. Assassinations against
  Central and South American leaders and revolutionaries, as well as Africa, Middle East and East Asia.  The list
  was tremendous.  They even declassified a “Heart Attack Gun” the Agency had made for the use of killing someone
  without it being detected.  Cancer, car accidents, skiing accidents, suicide, boating accidents, heart attacks,
  and just plain being shot were common assassination methods.  The hearings, although recorded in full in congressional
   record, the mainstream media and official policies, is still largely not taught in American schools on recent history.
     The American public still has no idea this was ever actually confirmed or even took place.  It is common for people
      to still refer to any of these assassinations as a joke or made up conspiracy.</p>
