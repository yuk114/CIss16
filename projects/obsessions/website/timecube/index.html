  <p class="about1">Time Cube was a personal web page operated by self-proclaimed "wisest man on earth" Otis Eugene "Gene" Ray, founded in 1997. It served as a self-publishing outlet for Ray's theory of everything, called "Time Cube," which claims that all current sciences are part of a worldwide conspiracy to teach people lies; the theory's ultimate truth (and what the conspirators are said to be covering up) is that each day actually consists of four days.[4] Alongside these statements Ray described himself as a "godlike" being with superior intelligence who has "absolute" evidence and proof for his views. Academia has not taken Time Cube seriously.</p>
