  <p class="about1">One of the worst kept secrets among government agencies was finally revealed by the CIA in 2013, as Area 51 in Nevada was finally acknowledged as a
  test ground for the United States government.
  After years of strange sightings above this remote location approximately 100 miles outside of Las Vegas, the Freedom of Information Act let Americans know about many of
  the things that occurred in the place known as Area 51 since the Cold War.
  The famous U-2 spy plane along with many other of our most secretive planes were built and tested at Area 51. Up until recently we were never 100% sure about what
  existed in Area 51, but with the magic of Google Maps we now know there is something behind those barbed wire fences.</p>
  <p class="about2">In face Area 51 security adds to the hype as anyone coming even near the fences around this area will be apprehended by a small army of military and
  other government security. Obviously, with this much security in a place that is not advertised to the public means that there is probably s
  omething to hide. While much of it is government and military classified work, others suggest that there may be more. Let’s look at some more of what we do know.</p>
  <p class="about3">Spawning a popular TV series with the same name, countless cable television series and many documentaries the alleged Roswell alien crash in July 1947
  was the encounter that put Area 51 on the map as far as it goes with alien conspiracies.
  While we save the in depth coverage of this event for another post, we will cover a brief overview of what happened below that backs up some of the alleged Area 51
  conspiracies.</p>

  <p class="about4">On July 1947 a rancher by the name of Mac Brazel found strange metal strewn over his land in New Mexico.
  Brazel took this debris to the authorities in Roswell. The commanding officer at the time Colonel Blanchard was also intrigued and he ordered an investigation.
  After collecting the shrapnel and other evidence off of Brazel’s property, the first Army command at Roswell issued a press release stating that they had recovered
  some type of “flying disk”.After this the Army later retracted the statement and  suggested that it was shrapnel from a weather balloon. Not until some 30 years later
  in the 1970s did the Roswell conspiracy theories become popular among theorists, when Jesse Marcel commented publicly about the Roswell event.
  There are numerous different theories tied to Roswell and Area 51, with one of the biggest is that Area 51 is used as a hiding ground of the flying
  objects and secret alien bodies that were discovered in this wreckage.</p>
<p class="about5">While many of the UFO and alien conspiracy theories may or may not be true,  the fact that the United States government now admits that Area 51 is real is a fact. Many of our national defense planes and other aircrafts are thought to be built and tested in the large area above and around Area 51. Many of these secret aircrafts put the Area 51 conspiracies to rest, as they are aircrafts that have never been shown to the American public.

One of the most talked about stealth aircrafts of all-time known as the “Aurora Project” is thought to be flown around the Area 51. This aircraft is allegedly the fastest aircraft ever created with speed up to Mach 6. Many look at the runway of Groom Lake, which is supposedly 6 miles long, as a clear indication of a place that supersonic aircrafts are tested.

Area 51 is one of the most widely recognized secrets in the United States. While only a select few know for sure what happens in this facility, many believe that there are supernatural events and government tests that would change the way we feel about the universe. Will Area 51 conspiracy theories last forever or will the United States government eventually come clean about everything that happens behind the barbed wired fences?</p>
