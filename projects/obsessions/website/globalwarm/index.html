  <p class="about1">Although it is undeniable that the average temperature of the climate system has increased in recent years,
  the reason for the increase is a bit more controversial. Is it cyclical, man made, are the thermometers broken?
  It seems as though there is no consensus and everyone is pointing the conspiracy finger at everyone else.</p>
  <p class="about2">The global warming conspiracy theory invokes claims that scientific consensus on global warming is based on conspiracies to produce
  false data or suppress dissent. It is one of a number of tactics used in climate change denial to legitimize political global warming controversy disputing
  this consensus. Global warming conspiracy theorists typically allege that, through worldwide acts of professional and criminal misconduct,
  the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons, or both.</p>
  <p class="about3">In a speech given to the US Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works on July 28, 2003, entitled "The Science of Climate Change",
  Senator James Inhofe (Republican, for Oklahoma) concluded by asking the following question: "With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science,
  could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people?" He further stated, "some parts of the IPCC process resembled a
  Soviet-style trial, in which the facts are predetermined, and ideological purity trumps technical and scientific rigor."
  Inhofe has suggested that supporters of the Kyoto Protocol such as Jacques Chirac are aiming at global governance.
  Commenting on criticism of the Lavoisier Group by Clive Hamilton, the Cooler Heads Coalition notes that "Hamilton accuses the Lavoisier Group of painting the UN's global
  warming negotiations as "an elaborate conspiracy in which hundreds of climate scientists have twisted their results to support the climate change theory in order to
  protect their research funding" and adds, "Sounds plausible to us."</p>
  <p class="about4">William M. Gray said in 2006 that global warming became a political cause because of the lack of any other enemy following the end of the Cold War.
  He went on to say that its purpose was to exercise political influence, to try to introduce world government, and to control people, adding, "I have a demonic view on this."
  The TV documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle was made by Martin Durkin, who called global warming "a multi-billion-dollar worldwide industry,
  created by fanatically anti-industrial environmentalists." In the Washington Times in 2007 he said that his film would change history, and predicted that
  "in five years the idea that the greenhouse effect is the main reason behind global warming will be seen as total bunk."
  Climate change has also been called the "greatest scam in history" by John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel.
  When questioned by the IPCC regarding his claims, he responded "The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar Bears are increasing in number."
  In 2012, Donald Trump claimed that "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."</p>
