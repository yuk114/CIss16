  <p class="about1">Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972.
  While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasnâ€™t until 1974 that White House tape recordings
  linked President Nixon to the break-in and forced him to resign.</p>

<p class="about3">Easily one of the most important (if not the most important) recording in the Watergate tapes. This exchange between Nixon and John Dean shows that Nixon knew
about Watergate and was involved in the cover up. At the time mark, 29:57 is the infamous exchange.
