  <p class="about1">"A number of U-boats took certain Nazis and Nazi loot to Argentina, where the Nazis were supported by future president Juan Perón, who,
  with his wife "Evita", had been receiving money from the Nazis for some time. Hitler allegedly arrived in Argentina, first staying at Hacienda San Ramón,
  east of San Carlos de Bariloche. Hitler then moved to a Bavarian-styled mansion at Inalco, a remote and barely accessible spot at the northwest end of Lake Nahuel Huapi,
  close to the Chilean border. Around 1954, Eva Braun left Hitler and moved to Neuquén with their daughter, Ursula ("Uschi"); and Hitler died in February 1962."</p>

  <p class="about2">This theory of Hitler's flight to Argentina has been dismissed by mainstream historians, including by Guy Walters.
  He has described Dunstan and Williams' theory as "rubbish", adding: "There's no substance to it at all. It appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists".
  Waters contends "it is simply impossible to believe that so many people could keep such a grand scale deception so quiet", saying "no serious historian would give
  the story any credence".</p>
