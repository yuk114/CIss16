  <p class="about1">When the exhaust from a planeâ€™s engine hits the cold air and begins to condense it leaves a vapor trail also known as a contrail.
  Some people, however, exercising their paranoia are convinced that the government is spraying chemical agents at its citizens from 30,000 feet hence the name, chemtrail.</p>
  <p class="about2">The chemtrail conspiracy theory is the unproven belief that long-lasting trails, so-called "chemtrails",
  are left in the sky by high-flying aircraft and that they consist of chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed for sinister purposes undisclosed to the
  general public.
  Believers in the theory argue that normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly and that contrails that do not dissipate must contain additional substances.
  These arguments have been dismissed by the scientific community: such trails are normal water-based contrails (condensation trails) that are routinely left by
  high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions.
  Although proponents have attempted to prove that the claimed chemical spraying does take place,
  their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions.</p>
