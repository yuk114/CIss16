  <p class="about1">The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory is the argument that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941,
  attack on Pearl Harbor.
  Ever since the Japanese attack there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of
  Japanese plans for an attack.
  In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee,
  launched Pearl Harbor revisionism when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.</p>
  <p class="about2">Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett,[5] retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald,[6] and Harry Elmer Barnes
   have argued various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it
   in order to force America into the European theatre of World War II via a Japaneseâ€“American war started at "the back door".[
   Evidence supporting this view is taken from quotations and source documents from the time and the release of newer materials.
   However, the Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy is considered to be a fringe theory and is rejected by most historians.</p>
