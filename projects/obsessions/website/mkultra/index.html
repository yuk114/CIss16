  <p class="about1">In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA ran a mind-control project aimed at finding a “truth serum” to use on communist spies.
  Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured.
  At least one man, civilian biochemist Frank Olson, who was working for the government, died as a result of the experiments.
  The project was finally exposed after investigations by the Rockefeller Commission.</p>
