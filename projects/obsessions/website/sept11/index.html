  <p class="about1">9/11 conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories that attribute the planning and execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States
  to parties other than, or in addition to, al-Qaeda including that there was advance knowledge of the attacks among high-level government officials.
  Government investigations and independent reviews have found no evidence for the theories.
  Proponents of these theories claim there are inconsistencies in the official conclusions, or evidence that was either ignored or overlooked.</p>
  <p class="about2">The most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of a controlled demolition
  rather than structural failure due to impact and fire.
  Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government
   or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military.
   Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq
   (even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks)[9] to advance their geostrategic interests,
   such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan.[10] Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities
   having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers. Another popular theory is that the collapse of the buildings
   was orchestrated due to many saying that jet fuel melted the steel beams.
   <p class="about3">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the technology magazine Popular Mechanics have investigated and rejected the claims
   made by 9/11 conspiracy theories.
   The civil engineering community accepts that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition,
   led to the collapse of the Twin Towers. This also was the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Governor Thomas Kean.</p>
