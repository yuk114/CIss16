  <p class="about1">Amazing as it may seem, given that it can't do anything else you actually ask it to do, Siri can predict the apocalypse. When asked "What day is 27th July 2014?", Apple's cheery assistant replied, "The opening of the gate of Hades", aka The End Of The World. That date has now passed without issue. Say what you like about the maligned MS Office paperclip, but at least he didn't scaremonger that the end was nigh.</p>
