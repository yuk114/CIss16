  <p class="about1">Turns out that teen high school comedy Saved By The Bell was riddled with hidden messages endorsing Satanism.
  It is believed by 'illuminatiwatcher.com/' that Saved By The Bell was a vehicle for the Illuminati.
  Despite the Illuminati being all-powerful space lizards who control the world and everything in it,
  they couldn't find it in their scaly little hearts to reward the guy who played Mr. Belding with an Oscar. Some gratitude, eh?</p>
