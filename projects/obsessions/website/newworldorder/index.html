  <p class="about1"> This popular conspiracy theory claims that a small group of international elites controls and manipulates governments,
  industry and media organisations worldwide. The primary tool they use to dominate nations is the system of central banking.
  They are said to have funded and in some cases caused most of the major wars of the last 200 years, primarily through carrying out false flag attacks to manipulate
  populations into supporting them, and have a grip on the world economy, deliberately causing inflation and depressions at will.
  The people behind the New World Order are thought to be international bankers, in particular the owners of the private banks in the Federal Reserve System,
  Bank of England and other central banks, and members of the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group.
  Now, although this conspiracy theory was ridiculed for years, it turns out that the Bilderberg does meet and requests no media coverage.  They receive no media coverage.
  The world’s elite meet every year and it goes largely unreported, for what?</p>

  <p class="about2">Discussions at the meetings include the economy, world affairs, war and in general, world policy.
  After the financial collapse, the Bilderberg played a key role in proposing that the world prepare for a new world order and have a standard world currency.
  This was propsed shortly after by almost all attendees of the Bilderberg meeting.  During the 20th century, many statesmen, such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill,
  used the term “new world order” to refer to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power after World War I and
  World War II. They all saw these periods as opportunities to implement idealistic or liberal proposals for global governance only in the sense of new collective efforts to
  identify, understand, or address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve. These proposals led to the creation of international
  organizations, such as the United Nations and N.A.T.O., and international regimes, such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
  were calculated both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism.  In the aftermath
  f the two World Wars, progressives welcomed these new international organizations and regimes but argued they suffered from a democratic deficit and therefore were inadequate
  o not only prevent another global war but also foster global justice.  American banker David Rockefeller joined the Council on Foreign Relations as its youngest-ever
  director in 1949 and subsequently became chairman of the board from 1970 to 1985; today he serves as honorary chairman. In 2002, Rockefeller authored his autobiography
  Memoirs wherein, on page 405, he wrote:</p>
  <p class="about3">“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents …
  to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are
  part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with
  others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and
  I am proud of it.”</p>
  <p class="about4">Thus, activists around the globe formed a world federalist movement bent on creating a “real” new world order.
  A number of Fabian socialist intellectuals, such as British writer H. G. Wells in the 1940s, appropriated and redefined the term “new world order”
  as a synonym for the establishment of a full-fledged social democratic world government.  In the 1960s, a great deal of right-wing conspiracist attention,
  by groups like the John Birch Society and the Liberty Lobby, focused on the United Nations as the vehicle for creating the “One World Government”,
  and contributed to a conservative movement for United States withdrawal from the U.N.. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet The Profound
  Revolution, traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the creation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913 by international bankers, who she
  claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as the shadow government. At the time the booklet was published, “international bankers”
  would have been interpreted by many readers as a reference to a postulated “international Jewish banking conspiracy” masterminded by the Rothschilds and
  Rockefellers.  American televangelist Pat Robertson with his 1991 best-selling book The New World Order became the most prominent Christian popularizer of
  conspiracy theories about recent American history as a theater in which Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, Council on Foreign Relations,
  Bilderberg Group, and Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging us constantly and covertly in the direction
  of world government for the Antichrist.</p>
 <p class="about5">After the turn of the century, specifically during the financial crisis of 2007–2009, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown,
 Henry Kissinger, and Barack Obama, used the term “new world order” in their advocacy for a Keynesian reform of the global financial system and their calls for a
 “New Bretton Woods”, which takes into account emerging markets such as China and India. These declarations had the unintended consequence of providing fresh
 fodder for New World Order conspiracism, and culminated in former Clinton administration adviser Dick Morris and conservative talk show host Sean Hannity arguing
 on one of his Fox News Channel programs that “conspiracy theorists were right”.  In 2009, American film directors Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World
 Order, a critically-acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists, such as American radio host Alex Jones, who are committed to
 exposing and vigorously opposing what they perceive to be an emerging New World Order.</p>
