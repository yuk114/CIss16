  <p class="about1">"Of course the 'dinoceros' existed," Pastor Vince Fenech told MaltaToday in 2009. "It is mentioned in the Book of Job. They were used to help build the pyramids..."
Fenech was director of the Accelerated Christian Academy in Mosta, Malta, until its closure in July 2012. Rather sadly, given its thrilling sci-fi curriculum, the school closed due to its having no students enrolled.</p>
