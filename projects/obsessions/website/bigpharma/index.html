  <p class="about1">We love to hate drug companies.
  They make insane profits off of expensive products that people literally canâ€™t live without.
  Not surprisingly this is also fertile ground for budding conspiracy theorists with many accusing the pharmaceutical companies, along with other medical providers, of
  conspiring to keep people sick by not disclosing various cures that have already been found.</p>
  <p class="about2">According to the Big Pharma conspiracy theory the medical establishment in general, and pharmaceutical companies in particular,
  operate for sinister purposes and against the public good.</p>
