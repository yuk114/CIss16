  <p class="about1">Karen was an American labor union activist and chemical technician at the Kerr-McGee plant near Crescent, Oklahoma, United States.
Silkwood’s job was making plutonium pellets for nuclear reactor fuel rods.  After being hired at Kerr-McGee, Silkwood joined the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union local and took part in a strike at the plant. After the strike ended, she was elected to the union’s bargaining committee and assigned to
investigate health and safety issues. She discovered what she believed to be numerous violations of health regulations, including exposure of workers to
contamination, faulty respiratory equipment and improper storage of samples. She also believed the lack of sufficient shower facilities could increase the risk
of employee contamination.  In the summer of 1974, Silkwood testified to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) about these issues, alleging that safety standards
had slipped because of a production speedup which resulted in employees being given tasks for which they were poorly trained. She also alleged that Kerr-McGee
employees handled the fuel rods improperly and that the company falsified inspection records.  On November 5, 1974, Silkwood performed a routine self-check and
found almost 400 times the legal limit for plutonium contamination. She was decontaminated at the plant and sent home with a testing kit to collect urine and
feces for further analysis. Oddly, though there was plutonium on the exterior surfaces (the ones she touched) of the gloves she had been using, the gloves
did not have any holes.</p>
<p class="about2">This suggests the contamination did not come from inside the glove box, but from some other source,
in other words, someone was trying to poison her.  The next morning, as she headed to a union negotiation meeting, she again tested positive for plutonium.
This was surprising because she had only performed paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intense decontamination. The following day,
November 7, 1974, as she entered the plant, she was found to be dangerously contaminated — even expelling contaminated air from her lungs.
A health physics team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces — especially in the bathroom and the
refrigerator. The house was later stripped and decontaminated. Silkwood, her partner and housemate were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory
for in-depth testing to determine the extent of the contamination in their bodies.  Later that evening, Silkwood’s body was found in her car,
which had run off the road and struck a culvert. The car contained no documents. She was pronounced dead at the scene from a “classic, one-car
sleeping-driver accident”.</p>
