  <p class="about1">The theory that the second Gulf War was waged in order to close a stargate owned by Saddam Hussein, thus preserving the ambitions of the New World Order and preventing an alien invasion of Earth is not exactly widespread. However, if you study the picture on the left closely, it looks suspiciously like Saddam could be saying, "Stargate? Yeah mate. It's out the back. Wanna have a look?" And that's evidence enough for us.</p>
