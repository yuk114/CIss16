  <p class="about1">British businessman Cecil Rhodes advocated the British Empire reannexing the United States of America and reforming itself into
  an “Imperial Federation” to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace. In his first will, of 1877, written at the age of 23,
  he expressed his wish to fund a secret society (known as the Society of the Elect) that would advance this goal:
  “To and for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be
  for the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom,
  and of colonization by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labor and enterprise,
  and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley of the Euphrates,
  the Islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole of South America, the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain,
  the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an
  integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may
  tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to render wars impossible,
  and promote the best interests of humanity.”</p>
  <p class="about2">In his later wills, a more mature Rhodes abandoned the idea and instead concentrated on what became the Rhodes Scholarship,
  which had British statesman Alfred Milner as one of its trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace
  among the great powers by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having
  enabled them to study for free at the University of Oxford.  Milner and British official Lionel George Curtis were the architects of the Round
   Table movement, a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded
   the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating for the creation of
    an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian
    God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states
    rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.  The Council on Foreign Relations began in 1917 with a
    group of New York academics who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period.</p>
  <p class="about3">Originally envisioned as a British-American group of scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement,
  it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient
   and U.S. secretary of state, Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a
   quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs.  Some believe that the Council on Foreign Relations is a front organization
    for the Round Table as a tool of the “Anglo-American Establishment”, which they believe has been plotting from 1900 on to rule the world. The
    research findings of historian Carroll Quigley, author of the 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American
     Old Right (Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though he argued that the Establishment is not involved
     n a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic
      elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in
      influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World
      War II and the Suez Crisis. Today it is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth
       of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite
       was in charge and acting responsibly.</p>
  <p class="about4">American banker David Rockefeller joined the Council on Foreign Relations as its youngest-ever director in 1949 and subsequently
  became chairman of the board from 1970 to 1985; today he serves as honorary chairman. In 2002, Rockefeller authored his autobiography Memoirs wherein,
  on page 405, he wrote: “For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized
  incidents … to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as
  'internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one
  world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”  Barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious
  (the claim of “conspiracy” or “treason”) and partly serious – the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and
  Japan, for example – an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the internationalist wing of the Republican Party when there was an internationalist wing.
  However, the statement is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations (itself alleged
  to be a front for an “international banking cabal”, as well as, it is claimed, the sponsor of many “globalist” think tanks such as the Trilateral Commission)
  uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order.</p>
  <p class="about5">Conspiracy theorists fear that the international bankers of financial capitalism are planning to eventually subvert the independence
  of the U.S. by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for International Settlements with the intent to “create a world system of
  financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole”.  In a 13 November
  2007 interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford, Rockefeller countered:  “I don’t think that I really feel that we need a world government.
  We need governments of the world that work together and collaborate. But, I can’t imagine that there would be any likelihood or even that it would be
  desirable to have a single government elected by the people of the world … There have been people, ever since I’ve had any kind of position in the world,
  who have accused me of being ruler of the world. I have to say that I think for the large part, I would have to decide to describe them as crackpots.
  It makes no sense whatsoever, and isn’t true, and won’t be true, and to raise it as a serious issue seems to me to be irresponsible.”  Some American
  social critics, such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an “imperial brain trust”, which has, for decades, played a
  central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-WWII international order and the Cold War, by determining what
  options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table; while others, such as G. William Domhoff, argue that it is in fact
  a mere policy discussion forum, which provides the business input to U.S. foreign policy planning. The latter argue that it has nearly 3,000 members,
  far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group; all the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates and speakers; and as far as being
  secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives.</p>
