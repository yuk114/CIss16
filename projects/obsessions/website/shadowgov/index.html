  <p class="about1">It is also called the “Deep State” by Peter Dale Scott, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
  A shadow government is a “government-in-waiting” that remains in waiting with the intention of taking control of a government in response to
  some event.  It turned out this was true on 9/11, when it was told to us by our mainstream media.  For years, this was ridiculed as a
  silly, crazy conspiracy theory and, like the others listed here, turned out to be 100% true.  It is also called the Continuity of Government.
   The Continuity of Government (COG) is the principle of establishing defined procedures that allow a government to continue its essential
   operations in case of nuclear war or other catastrophic event.  Since the end of the cold war, the policies and procedures for the COG have
    been altered according to realistic threats of that time.  These include but are not limited to a possible coup or overthrow by right
    wing terrorist groups, a terrorist attack in general, an assassination, and so on.  Believe it or not the COG has been in effect since 2001.
    After 9/11, it went into action.  Now here is the kicker, many of the figures in Iran Contra, the Watergate Scandal, the alleged conspiracy
    to assassinate Kennedy, and many others listed here are indeed members of the COG.  This is its own conspiracy as well.</p>
