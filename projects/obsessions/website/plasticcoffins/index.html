  <p class="about1">Just outside Atlanta, Georgia, beside a major road are approximately 500,000 plastic coffins. Stacked neatly and in full view, the coffins are allegdly owned
  by FEMA. Conspriacy theorists believe that FEMA has also set up several concentration campls in the US in preparation for the imposition of a state martial law and the
  killing of millions of Americans. They suggest that the financial crisis will be used to justify the imposition of a police state. Many also believe these coffins will be used
  for mass vaults if any disease were to spread amongst the masses.</p>
