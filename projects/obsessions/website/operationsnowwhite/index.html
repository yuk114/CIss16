  <p class="about1"> Some time during the 1970s, the Church of Scientology decided that they’d had enough.  Apparently, the Church of Scientology managed to perform the largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Ever.  5,000 of Scientology’s crack commandos wiretapped and burglarized various agencies. They stole hundreds of documents, mainly from the IRS. No critic was spared, and in the end, 136 organizations, agencies and foreign embassies were infiltrated.</p>
