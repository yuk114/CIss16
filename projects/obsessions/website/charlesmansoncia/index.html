  <p class="about1">A guy named Chuck Schlund claimed to have found the “Don Bolles Papers,” which detailed the CIA’s involvement with the Manson Family murders. He said, “The CIA needed a way of showing the American people that these pretty [protesters] were really Satanists and evil and that the government was right and just in the war.”
