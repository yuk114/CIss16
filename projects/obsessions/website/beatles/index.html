  <p class="about1">Conspiracy theorists have alleged the Fab Four group were formed of “multiples” and “body doubles”, not the four, individual men from Liverpool we have been led to believe.</p>
  <p class="about2">And they claim there's visible proof that photos of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr differ throughout Beatlemania – making it “impossible” for the music icons to have been the same people.</p>
  <p class="about3">A website called The Beatles Never Existed (TBNE) alleges that “gruelling schedules” led to the decision for alternate Beatles “clones”.
  <p class="about4">The founder of the fan page blog, Dorie, states: "Even if one or two [photos] are doctored here or there, and someone had surgery, why don't they all match?
  <p class="about5">“They look different instead of identical.”
    Dorie claims there are at least three Johns dating back to 1963.</p>
  <p class="about6">Photos of Lennon – believed to have been taken at the time of The Beatles album in 1963 and the White Album in 1968 – allegedly show “significantly different” people.</p>

  <p class="about7">Dorie added, "[The] biggest discrepancies I see are his lips [they are] curved and then straight.
    “The space between his eyes [there is a] big difference.”
    The barmy theory even suggested the music icons were interchanged within a matter of months and even recycled.
    Another John substitute allegedly occurred during the seven months between the With the Beatles album and A Hard Day’s Night in 1964.</p>

  <p class="about8">Photos taken at the time of each album appear to show difference pupil alignment and the distance between his eyes seems to change.
    But allegedly the John from A Hard Day’s Night pop up again almost four years later in Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.
    According to photos – taken at the time of each album – all John’s facial features match when they are overlaid.
    Dorie also claims the different Lennons interchanged between “shorter, straighter noses” to “longer, more complex noses” and had “noticeably different” ears.</p>
  <p class="about9">Paul McCartney, on the other hand, has at least 12 different documented multiples according to TBNE truth seekers.
    Pictures taken during the time of Beatlemania allegedly show the star with different face shapes, ears and nose as well as a disappearing and re-appearing "chin scar".
    One alleged “fake Paul” was uncovered after he appeared to lose an eye-colour changing contact during the We Can Work it Out music video.
    Like John, the conspiracy theorists claim the 1963 ”Paul" may also have been recycled multiple times including in 1984 and might even been the sample person used today.</p>

  <p class="about10">But some fans claim the <a href="../paulmccartney/index.html">"real" Paul may have died in a car crash in 1966.</a>
    George Harrison and Ringo Starr also have body doubles according to The Beatle Never Existed theory - but it is unclear how may there were during Beatlemania.
    Photos of George allegedly vary between the Beatles star having level eyes, a lower left or right eye.
    His teeth apparently change too.</p>
  <p class="about11">According to Dorie, George in the Hello, Goodbye video also appears very “zombie-like”.
    Ringo’s alleged doubles, on the other hand, appear to feature different heights, beard growth and teeth.
    Noticeably shorter than the other Beatles in most photos, some images shows him on par.</p>
