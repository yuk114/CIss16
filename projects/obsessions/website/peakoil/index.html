  <p class="about1">The Peak Oil Conspiracy traces it’s roots back to geologist Marion King Hubbert back in 1956.
  He presented a paper indicating that any finite resource must have a beginning, middle and end of production and must reach a point of maximum output followed by decline.
  Thus technology will keep improving to extract oil at a faster rate which must eventually reach a point of decline. He accurately predicted a decline in oil in the 60’s and 70’s which marked him as the first to bring the problem of peak oil to public attention. The term “peak oil” refers to maximum production of oil, not to the falling supply of oil.</p>
  <p class="about2">The main peak oil conspiracy put forward is that there is no shortage of Oil and that artificial demand is created by the oil barons.
  The oil companies are aware of peak oil, but does not utilize additional reservoirs because it needs to maintain the illusion of scarcity.
  If there is a perceived shortage of oil then prices can shoot through the roof, as has happened historically.
  It is true that an decrease of supply will result in an increase of price and therefore more money for oil producers who hold oil.
  And it would be in their interest for the prices of oil to go up.
  However this is not to say that the Oil Industries somehow have all scientists, geologists and the world at large completely fooled by fabricating the message that oil supplies are running out,
  in much the same way that Climate Change is not a giant hoax pulled off by the environmental energy sector.
  Such claims need evidence to back them up, of which there is little.
  Further it would take a collusion of all oil barons involved, which is unlikely.</p>
  <p class="about3">Little credence can be given to this theory. Oil is not renewable in any way.
  It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that oil is biotic in origin and non renewable.
  And the point would be moot in any case. We are using oil faster than it would be replenished leaving the world in the same position with regard to peak oil –
  Needing to find an alternative energy source.</p>
  <p class="about4">There are many who contend that alternative energy sources are alive and well and actively suppressed,
  in order for the energy industries to maintain their monopoly.
  The energy industry is huge, and should an alternative energy source be developed it will end a lot of multi billion dollar industries.
  All appliances run on energy. All cars run on energy. All manufacturing runs on energy. There is huge wealth in the oil industry.
  Thus should a renewable device be developed which powers your house, car and everything else, it would definitely be a crippling blow to a variety of monopolies and a
  massive plus to ordinary citizens, as energy would be more or less free.</p>
