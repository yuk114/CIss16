  <p class="about1">Jesus and Mary Magdalene might have been married, or so says the Gospel of Philip.
  Sure, it's the basic plot of The Da Vinci Code (the thriller also wraps in conspiracy shibboleths like Opus Dei and the Knights Templar for good measure) —
  but the theory finds its basis in writings from the Gnostic Gospels, which were discovered in 1945 and whose authenticity religious experts still dispute.
  In the Gospel of Philip, Mary Magdalene, who is referred to as Jesus' koinonos, a Greek term for "companion" or "partner," is depicted as being closer to Jesus than any
  other apostle.</p>
  <p class="about2">In an exchange between Peter and Mary, he admits to her that "the Saviour loved you above all other women" — a tense moment in the scripture that seems
  to portray the jealousy that the other apostles might have felt for Mary's relationship with Jesus.
  The only other evidence used to support the theory is a mention of Jesus kissing Mary often, but some say kissing was the custom and it was typical of Jesus to practice
  it with those close to him. (Remember Judas?)</p>
