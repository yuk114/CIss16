  <p class="about1">The Flat Earth Society was established in the early 1800s by the English inventor Samuel Birley Rowbotham and remains at the very forefront of 11th Century thinking. 'Zetetic Astronomy', as the society prefers to call it, has had to explain away many threats to its principles over the years. Things like manned missions to the moon, satellites, photographs of the (round) Earth from space, and three series of Prof. Brian Cox's inspirational TV shows.Still, they've got 1,800 likes on Facebook. Which isn't bad going, assuming the internet exists, of course.
