  <p class="about1">Black Helicopters are not just helicopters with a black paint-job as you may have been told.
  They are, in fact, autonomous agents -- lifeforms -- created by New World Order (NWO) agencies via nanobiotechnology.
  Their primary purpose is to spy on the activities of average citizens in order to gather tactical information and discover
  "subversives" who are not bowing to the will of the Liberati's UN-backed Federal Government.
  Furthermore, when the <a href="../newworldorder/index.html">NWO</a> Invasion takes place in the not-too-distant future, they will round up citizens for internment in concentration camps or carry out the
  elimination of the more vocally anti-Liberati.</p>
  <p class="about2">Black Helicopters have a complex reproductive cycle with different phases.
  They start out as seed crystals that are injected into a biological host organism -- typically cattle but occasionally humans -- by either human technicians or other Black Helicopters.
  It has also been theorized that seed crystals have been sprayed from military and possibly civil aircraft in the form of so-called "chemtrails", which then enter the body of a host via the food and/or water supply or direct dermal contact.
  The inoculated seed crystal uses nanobiotechnology -- which incorporates nano-scale self-manufacturing robotics with biological control systems created using genetic engineering -- to grow with material synthesized from the host's organs.
  After being injected into the head of a cattle, typically the seed crystal enters the blood stream where it travels to the intestines, along the way gathering various needed compounds from different systems.
  Once there, it quickly develops into a Microscopic Black Helicopter (MBH).</p>

  <p class="about3">These small and simplified versions of BHs will either stay in the host and continue growing to maturity or they will sometimes exit the body at this stage, usually burrowing through the skin.
  MBHs that grow to maturity in their hosts will later go on to become the full size BHs that most people report seeing.
  After a few weeks, the MBH grows large enough (about 20-30 cm in length,) that it bursts forth from the guts of its host.
  This artificial live birth leaves the host organism dead and is the source of most cattle mutilations.
  Bursting is usually timed so that it occurs at night, providing cover of darkness.
  After the burst, the new BH takes a few minutes for its props to unfold and harden before flying off.
  Once old enough to burst from its host, it has the ability to gather further minerals and proteins from its environment, allowing it to grow to full mature size (up to 18 meters long.)</p>
  <p class="about4">These macroscopic BHs that have not yet reached their full mature size are called Juvenile Black Helicopters (JBH).
  They can be found in wildernesses or on the outskirts of civilization, avoiding human observation and biding their time while they grow.
  If discovered by persons or agents unaligned with the NWO, JBHs may react violently to eliminate any witnesses; however,
  since many are equipped with psychotron organs grown from environmental aluminum compounds or beer cans scavenged from road sides,
  they may instead simply cause short- to mid-term memory loss in observers before escaping, resulting in the phenomenon known as "lost time",
  which is often mistakenly attributed to UFO abduction. (Note: if the JBH discovers that the observer is wearing an AFDB,
  thus making psychotronically induced memory loss impossible, violence will most certainly ensue.)
  Additionally, some smaller sized JBHs are known to camouflage themselves as pigeons, squirrels, and other woodland or urban creatures by covering themselves with the outer casings of animals they killed for organic building materials,
  allowing them to spy on citizens in broad daylight.</p>
