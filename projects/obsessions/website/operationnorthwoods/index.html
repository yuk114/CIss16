  <p class="about1">In the early 1960s, American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel Castro from power.
  The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship, assassinating Cuban émigrés,
  sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership,
  then kept secret for nearly 40 years.</p>
