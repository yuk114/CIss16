  <p class="about1">The Trilateral Commission is a private organization, established to foster closer cooperation among the United States,
  Europe and Japan. It was founded in July 1973 at the initiative of David Rockefeller, who was Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations
  at that time. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.  In July 1972, Rockefeller
   called his first meeting, which was held at Rockefeller’s Pocantico compound in New York’s Hudson Valley. It was attended by about 250
   individuals who were carefully selected and screened by Rockefeller and represented the very elite of finance and industry.  Its first
   executive committee meeting was held in Tokyo in October 1973. The Trilateral Commission was officially initiated, holding biannual meetings.
   A Trilateral Commission Task Force Report, presented at the 1975 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, called An Outline for Remaking World Trade and
   Finance, said: “Close Trilateral cooperation in keeping the peace, in managing the world economy, and in fostering economic development and
   in alleviating world poverty, will improve the chances of a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system.” Another Commission document
   read:  “The overriding goal is to make the world safe for interdependence by protecting the benefits which it provides for each country against
    external and internal threats which will constantly emerge from those willing to pay a price for more national autonomy. This may sometimes
    require slowing the pace at which interdependence proceeds, and checking some aspects of it. More frequently however, it will call for checking
     the intrusion of national government into the international exchange of both economic and non-economic goods.”</p>
