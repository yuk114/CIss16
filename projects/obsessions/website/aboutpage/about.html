  <p class="about1">This archive was created to house a number of conspiracy theories.
    I chose this subject matter because i've always been interested in conspiracy thoeries.
    They interest me because sometimes they are proven to be true and other times they can be completely ridiculous but incredibly entertaining.
  </p>
  <p class="about2">The intention behind the layout of the website was to create a masonary layout.
    I wanted it to be random and with varying images and image sizes.
    The black and white filter applied to all images was done with the intention of creating a sense of darkness or eeriness.</p>
