  <p class="about1">The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972.
  During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more
  about the disease. While the study was initially supposed to last just six months, it continued for 40 years. Close to 200 of the men died from syphilis or
  related complications by the end of the study.</p>
