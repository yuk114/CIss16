  <p class="about1">For years, many conspiracy theorists were saying that the rich and powerful met every year in the woods and worshiped a giant
  stone owl in an occult fashion. For a long time it was believed that other weird things happened here. Many presidents have been in attentdance like Nixon and both Bush's.
  It turns out, ABC, CBS, NBC, and many other credible news agencies investigated this and found out, its true.
  It is said to be just all fun and games, like brotherhood style fraternity stuff.</p>
