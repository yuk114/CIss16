  <p class="about1">The HSCA was established in 1976 to investigate the John F. Kennedy assassination and the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination.
  The Committee investigated until 1978, and in 1979 issued its final report, concluding that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated by a conspiracy involving
  the mob, and potentially the CIA.
  The House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook reinvestigations of the murders of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1979,
  a single Report and twelve volumes of appendices on each assassination were published by the Congress.
  In the JFK case, the HSCA found that there was a “probable conspiracy,” though it was unable to determine the nature of that conspiracy or its other participants
  (besides Oswald). This finding was based in part on acoustics evidence from a tape purported to record the shots, but was also based on other evidence including an
  investigation of Ruby’s mafia connections and potential CIA and/or FBI connections to Oswald.</p>
  <p class="about2">To this day, many conspiracy deniers are unaware that the Congressional investigation into JFK’s assassination concluded beyond any shadow of a doubt that
  it was a conspiracy.
  What made them come to this conclusion?
  Aside from reading the report, many witnesses (some of whom were CIA agents and station chiefs in Dallas that morning) were killed the night before testifying.
  For example, George de Mohrenschildt was a petroleum geologist who befriended Lee Harvey Oswald during the months preceding the assassination of U.S. President
  John F. Kennedy.  He also worked for the CIA.  He also blew his brains out the night before he was to testify to the committee.
  The committee also uncovered, among many things, that Oswald left the marines where he learned how to speak fluent Russian (at the height of the cold war).
  He was given money by the State Department to travel to Russia where he stopped off in Japan at a top secret US Military facility.
  The Warren Commission even mentioned this part.  What most people do not know is that he probably was working in the Cold War infiltrating the Russians as either a
  “dangle,” “double agent,” or “defector” of some kind.
  What is interesting is that upon his return he got more money from the State Department to buy a house and work with an ex FBI Chief and CIA officials in training
  anti-Castro Cubans for an invasion.  In Louisiana, where he was working, the CIA was involved in Operation Mongoose,
  Where Oswald worked under CIA Agent David Ferrie, who killed himself before testifying in a trial on the Assassination as well.
  Operation Mongoose worked closely with Southern Mafia figures largely because the casinos in Cuba, which were shut down after Fidel obtained control over the country,
  were epicenters for control on the island.
  The CIA even hired the mafia to assassinate Fidel on many occasions, 3 attempts which failed are common knowledge.
  What is funny is that figures who worked very close with Oswald either ended up dead (over 100 of them connected to the assassination died within a few years of unusual
  circumstances) or they ended up in other conspiracies.</p>

  <p class="about3">For instance, E Howard Hunt (CIA Agent) confessed to being involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy on his deathbed.
  E Howard Hunt was one of the Watergate Burglars.  Barry Seal, who worked with Oswald and Ferrie ended up being one of the largest cocaine smugglers
  in the United States during Iran Contra, as a key player for the agency and informant for the DEA.
  There is so much more to get into, but there just isn’t enough time.
  Oswald’s tax returns are still classified top secret to this day.
  Why? Perhaps he was still getting $$ from the United States, which places him on the payroll.
  That money trail leads to figures, many of whom were murdered, that would have blown the story wide open.
  For 14 years, most didn’t know this.
  The HSCA investigaitons by congress went against the findings of the Warren Commission and both reports are from the same source, Congressional Committees.
  Which is true? Why do we only teach one to our children in school?</p>
