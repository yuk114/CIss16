  <p class="about1">The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy,
  and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), designed and built by BAE Advanced Technologies (BAEAT).</p>
  <p class="about2">HAARP is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.
  Various individuals have speculated about hidden motives and capabilities of the project.
  For example, Rosalie Bertell warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon.
  Michel Chossudovsky stated in a book published by the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform that "recent scientific evidence suggests that HAARP is fully operational
  and has the capability of triggering floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes."
  Over time, HAARP has been blamed for generating such catastrophes, as well as thunderstorms, in Iran, Pakistan, Haiti, Turkey, Greece and the Philippines,
  and even major power outages, the downing of <a href="../twaflight800/index.html">TWA Flight 800</a>, Gulf War syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>
  <p class="about3">Two Georgia men arrested on drug charges in November 2016 were reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP.
  The Coffee County Sheriff's Office say the men possessed a "massive arsenal" that included AR-15 rifles, Glock handguns, a Remington rifle and thousands of rounds of
  ammunition.
  According to police, the men wanted to destroy HAARP because they believed the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds and even traps the souls of people.
  Police say the men confessed that "God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released.</p>
  <p class="about4">Stanford University professor Umran Inan told Popular Science that weather-control conspiracy theories were "completely uninformed," explaining that
  "there's absolutely nothing we can do to disturb the Earth's [weather] systems. Even though the power HAARP radiates is very large, it's minuscule compared with the power
  of a lightning flashâ€”and there are 50 to 100 lightning flashes every second. HAARP's intensity is very small.
  Computer scientist David Naiditch characterizes HAARP as "a magnet for conspiracy theorists", saying that HAARP attracts their attention because,
  "its purpose seems deeply mysterious to the scientifically uninformed."
  Journalist Sharon Weinberger called HAARP "the Moby Dick of conspiracy theories," and said the popularity of conspiracy theories often overshadows the benefits HAARP may
  provide to the scientific community.
   Austin Baird writing in the Alaska Dispatch said, "What makes HAARP susceptible to conspiracy criticism is simple.
  The facility doesn't open its doors in the same way as other federally-funded research facilities around the country, and it doesn't go to great efforts to explain the
  importance of its research to the public." In August 2016, in response to these claims, the facility announced it would have an open day, allowing visitors to tour
  the complex.</p>
